        <p class="caption">Many users will often get a call from an 'unknown caller', and when they answer it, the person on the other side of the line will ask them for their information, such as their name, phone number, etc. Claiming that they are from a well known organization, a scammer will use a technique known as social engineering, which is used to obtain personal or confidential information, such as passwords. They can also be so dangerous, to threaten the user and manipulate them.</p>

            <p>Users can be easily manipulated, as they do not always know if the phone call is from a well known organization. Social engineering tricks them into giving the scammer what they need, so that the user is a victim of fraud, committed by the scammer.</p>

            <img src="styles/images/fraud.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width:100%; height: 230px;">
            <p>Users can have many different effects after being scammed. For instance, they can suffer from a significant loss of money. They can also be emotionally affected, as they will lose trust, whenever they are being called and asked for their personal information.</p>

            <img src="styles/images/scam-defense.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:100%; height: 230px;">
            <p>The most logical form of defense is to check if the call is from someone they know. If the call is not from someone they know, and seems reasonably suspicious, there is a good chance it is a scam. In this case, the most logical form of defense is to ignore and end the call.</p>
