        <p class="caption">Too much knowledge of modern technologies is dangerous, as hackers can use this knowledge for their advantage. They can often use their knowledge of programming to attack web servers. This is through 'injection' attacks in coding languages, such as HTML, JavaScript (JS) and Structured Query Language (SQL). Hackers can also use keystrokes to see what the user enters into their keyboard. They also use brute force attacks as a way to guess a user's password, by trying possible combinations. </p>

            <p>We are now moving to the dynamic era of the World Wide Web (WWW). With more database-driven web applications, data is constantly changing. While this is an advancement in technology, it poses a big risk as hackers have their methods of attacking and 'injecting' the web servers of these applications.</p>

            <p>One of the most powerful ways a hacker can gain access to sensitive information from users. They use keystroke logging as a technique to record keystrokes after users type with their keyboard. They also use brute force attacks to guess passwords. To defend against this, passwords should have an increased length and be complex with various characters (lowercase, upercase, digits, etc).</p>

            <p>Ethical Hackers (Also known as white hat hackers) are those who are hired by companies and perform penetration tests and assess system vulnarabilities, by finding the 'weak' links. Today, many people are encouraged to work as penetration testers, to analyse system vulnarabilities, and combat cyber threats.</p>
