        <p class="caption">The majority of users have access to at least 1 social media account, whether it is email, Facebook, Messenger, or even Snapchat. We use social media as part of our everyday life, to share videos, photos and communicate with our friends. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us are restricted from visiting our friends, which has led social media to be our only form of communication. While it gives us these benefits, it also has its limits.</p>

            <img src="styles/images/bully.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:100%; height: 230px;">
            <p>Some users might use social media in the wrong way. They might see a post from someone and make comments about it in a way that causes the user to feel offended. According to Youth Law Australia (YLA), cyberbullies can be sent to prison for as long as 3 years. </p>

            <img src="styles/images/troll.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width:100%; height: 230px;">
            <p>Trolls are somewhat similar to cyberbullies. However, they are more of a type of threat that angers users on social media. The main purpose of trolling is to prank and provoke users to feel annoyed about the troll's actions.</p>

            <img src="styles/images/conspiracy.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width:100%; height: 230px;">
            <p>For a long time, the Internet has been the main place users go to seek information. However, it can be tricky to differentiate accurate information for inaccurate information. An example of conspiracy is when users on Facebook create posts, claming that the COVID-19 virus was a 'hoax'.</p>
